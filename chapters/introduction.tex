\Gls{spark} is the leading frontrunner in Big Data Analytics and Machine
Learning. A \gls{spark} application can run for days crunching on data and
churning out results. This is why most \gls{spark} applications utilize a
cluster of nodes to execute tasks to decrease the time. A \gls{spark} cluster
can be set up using its own cluster manager known as \gls{spark} Standalone
Cluster Manager or one of third party cluster managers like \gls{yarn},
\gls{mesos} or \gls{kubernetes}.

There are many orgranizations which require to run \gls{hpc} jobs as well as
Big Data jobs on a cluster. But none of the cluster managers which integrate
with \gls{spark} are capable of running an \gls{hpc} job, thus creating a need
to add \gls{pbs} as a pluggable scheduler in \gls{spark}. This project aims to
do just that.
